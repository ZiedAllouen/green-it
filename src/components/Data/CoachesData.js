        "Everyone will cope differently when they learn they are HIV-positive. Feeling sad, angry, or scared are all normal reactions. As Curt has found out, getting support from those around you can help you to manage your emotions during this difficult time.",

      review: "Mbali was brave and thought that she could handle her new diagnosis herself. She did well to tell her boss and get on treatment as soon as possible. It can take time to get used to a positive diagnosis and although she’s had some ups and downs with taking her treatment: she’s now taking it regularly and staying healthy. ",

      review:"When Talent found out he was HIV positive, he faced discrimination from his employers. To make sure other people don’t go through what Talent did, we have to keep challenging HIV stigma when we see it and help everyone to know their rights. Living with HIV shouldn’t stop you from living a normal and happy life.",

      review:" After he found out his status, Hamid felt his world had fallen apart. But it’s always better to know your status, so you can get on treatment if you need it and stay healthy. Talking to a trusted family member or friend can really help – and as Hamid found with his wife, their support can be a huge boost.",
